## Loan Application - Repayment Capability

About twenty years ago, personal loan is a thing that is very complicated in terms of the application process. It takes so much to process every loan application because they are do it manually through a loan analyst. But right now, there are so many companies that are offering a simple and quick loan application. So how do they do that? Did they force their loan analyst to work quick?. If no, who's do that? Yeah 'Machine Learning'. With machine learning we're be able to process the loan application quickly without having to analyze the entire application. We can train the machine learning model with a previous loan application data how to predict whether an applicant can repay the loan or not based on their profile.

So this project is aim to make some machine learning model to predict if an applicant is able to repay the lending company or not. We will prepare the data using Jupyter Notebook and use various models to predict the target variable.
